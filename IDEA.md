DoubtDesk - Chat Assistant for Course Doubts 

Description
Build a chat-based application where students can ask doubts in real time and get accurate answers directly from long-form course transcripts or SRT files (such as Udemy courses spanning 40–50 hours). The system must ingest transcripts along with timestamps, index them effectively and retrieve the most relevant sections when a doubt is asked. Each answer should be grounded in the transcript and include the exact timestamp reference, ideally with a “jump to video” (or) "jump to time" link for quick navigation. Accuracy is the top priority, responses should strictly rely on the provided transcripts without hallucination.
